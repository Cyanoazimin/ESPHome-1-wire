# ESPHome-1-wire

Connecting Maxim's 1-wire devices like DS2438 via ESPHome to Home Assistant.

A robust custom component for **ESPHome** to read temperature, input voltage (VAD), and supply voltage (VDD) from the **Maxim DS2438 Smart Battery Monitor** via the 1-Wire bus.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Fully Compatible with ESPHome 2025.12+**: Resolves Python class path issues and protected member access (`reset_`) introduced in recent ESPHome updates.
* **Dual Voltage Support**: Measures both **Input Voltage (VAD)** and **Bus Voltage (VDD)** by dynamically reconfiguring the chip's control register.
* **Reliable Data**: Implements the "Recall Memory" sequence to fetch fresh data from internal latches.
* **Stable Timing**: Includes appropriate delays for A/D conversion.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before using this component, ensure you have:
- **ESP32 or ESP8266** microcontroller board
- **Maxim DS2438 Smart Battery Monitor** IC
- **1-Wire pull-up resistor** (typically 4.7kΩ)
- Basic soldering skills and familiarity with ESPHome
- [ESPHome documentation](https://esphome.io/)
- [DS2438 Datasheet](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton/ibutton-products/DS2438.html)

## 🛠 Installation
1.  Create a folder named `my_components` in your ESPHome configuration directory (if it doesn't exist).
2.  Create a subfolder `ds2438`.
3.  Copy `sensor.py` and `ds2438.h` into `/config/esphome/my_components/ds2438/`.

Directory structure:
```text
/config/esphome/
├── my_components/
│   └── ds2438/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── sensor.py
│       └── ds2438.h
└── your_device.yaml
```

## 🔌 Hardware Wiring

Connect your DS2438 to your ESP board as follows:

| DS2438 Pin | ESP Pin | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| DQ (1)    | GPIO4   | Data line (1-Wire bus) with 4.7kΩ pull-up to VDD |
| GND (2)   | GND     | Ground |
| VDD (3)   | 3.3V    | Power supply (can use parasitic power from DQ if needed) |
| VAD (4)   | N/A     | Connect external sensor/battery |

**Finding your DS2438 address**: After configuration, check your ESPHome logs during the first boot to find your device's 1-Wire address. You can also use ESPHome's 1-Wire component debug mode to scan for devices.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Add the following to your ESPHome YAML configuration file:

```yaml
# 1. Define the 1-Wire Bus
one_wire:
  - platform: gpio
    pin: GPIO4
    id: one_wire_bus

# 2. Add the Custom Sensor
sensor:
  - platform: ds2438
    one_wire_id: one_wire_bus
    address: 0xd56dc98711646128
    update_interval: 60s
    temperature:
      name: "Battery Temperature"
    voltage:
      name: "Battery Input Voltage (VAD)"
      unit_of_measurement: "V"
    bus_voltage:
      name: "Bus Supply Voltage (VDD)"
      unit_of_measurement: "V"
```

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `address`: The 1-Wire address of your DS2438 (64-bit hex). Find this in the ESPHome logs after first boot.
- `update_interval`: How often to read the sensor (default: 60s). Increase for slower updates or decrease for more frequent readings.
- `one_wire_id`: Must match the ID defined in your 1-Wire bus configuration.

## 📖 Usage in Home Assistant

Once configured and deployed:

1. The three sensors will appear automatically in Home Assistant
2. Navigate to **Settings → Devices & Services → Entities**
3. Search for your device name (e.g., "Battery Temperature")
4. Add them to your dashboards, automations, or scripts
5. The sensors update at your configured interval (default: 60s)

Example Home Assistant automation:
```yaml
automation:
  - trigger:
      platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.battery_temperature
      above: 50
    action:
      service: persistent_notification.create
      data:
        message: "Battery temperature is critically high!"
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

The DS2438 shares a single A/D converter for both voltage inputs. This component handles the switching logic automatically, measuring VAD, waiting for conversion, and continuing with VDD.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Values stay at 0.00**: 
Check the ESPHome logs. If you see `Raw Data: 00 00 ...`, the chip might not be powered correctly:
- Ensure **VDD is properly connected** to 3.3V (not just relying on parasitic power)
- Verify the **1-Wire bus pull-up resistor** is correctly installed (4.7kΩ)
- Check that the **A/D conversion time is sufficient** (code uses safe defaults of 100ms)
- Confirm the **device address** is correct in your configuration

**Device not found on bus**:
- Verify GPIO pin number in your `one_wire` configuration
- Check for loose connections or cold solder joints
- Try increasing the `update_interval` to 30 seconds
- Enable debug logging in ESPHome to see 1-Wire bus activity

**Compilation Error: `reset_`**: 
This component uses a C++ access trick to call the protected `reset_()` method of the OneWireBus, which is required for ESPHome versions >= 2025.12. Ensure you're using ESPHome 2025.12 or later.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- The component requires **ESPHome 2025.12 or newer** due to API changes
- Only one DS2438 address can be configured per instance (create multiple sensors for multiple devices)
- Requires a stable power supply; parasitic power mode is not recommended for reliable operation
- A/D conversion takes ~100ms; very high update intervals may cause delays

## 📊 Example Output

Once working, your Home Assistant will show:
```
Battery Temperature: 24.5 °C
Battery Input Voltage (VAD): 4.15 V
Bus Supply Voltage (VDD): 3.28 V
```
